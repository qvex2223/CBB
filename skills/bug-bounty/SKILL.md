# Bug Bounty Master Workflow

Router for the full pipeline: Recon -> Learn -> Hunt -> Validate -> Report.
The routing decisions live here; the detail lives in `references/` and in the
owning `hunt-*` skills, so this file stays small enough to keep open while you work.

## THE ONLY QUESTION THAT MATTERS

> **"Can an attacker do this RIGHT NOW against a real user who has taken NO unusual actions -- and does it cause real harm (stolen money, leaked PII, account takeover, code execution)?"**
>
> If the answer is NO -- **STOP. Do not write. Do not explore further. Move on.**

### Theoretical Bug = Wasted Time. Kill These Immediately:

| Pattern | Kill Reason |
|---|---|
| "Could theoretically allow..." | Not exploitable = not a bug |
| "An attacker with X, Y, Z conditions could..." | Too many preconditions |
| "Wrong implementation but no practical impact" | Wrong but harmless = not a bug |
| Dead code with a bug in it | Not reachable = not a bug |
| Source maps without secrets | No impact |
| SSRF with DNS-only callback | Need data exfil or internal access |
| Open redirect alone | Need ATO or OAuth chain |
| "Could be used in a chain if..." | Build the chain first, THEN report |

**You must demonstrate actual harm. "Could" is not a bug. Prove it works or drop it.**

---

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **READ FULL SCOPE FIRST** -- verify every asset/domain is owned by the target org
2. **NO THEORETICAL BUGS** -- "Can an attacker steal funds, leak PII, takeover account, or execute code RIGHT NOW?" If no, STOP.
3. **KILL WEAK FINDINGS FAST** -- run the 7-Question Gate BEFORE writing any report
4. **Validate before writing** -- check CHANGELOG, design docs, deployment scripts FIRST
5. **One bug class at a time** -- go deep, don't spray
6. **Verify data isn't already public** -- check web UI in incognito before reporting API "leaks"
7. **5-MINUTE RULE** -- if a target shows nothing after 5 min probing (all 401/403/404), MOVE ON
8. **IMPACT-FIRST HUNTING** -- ask "what's the worst thing if auth was broken?" If nothing valuable, skip target
9. **CREDENTIAL LEAKS need exploitation proof** -- finding keys isn't enough, must PROVE what they access
10. **STOP SHALLOW RECON SPIRALS** -- don't probe 403s, don't grep for analytics keys, don't check staging domains that lead nowhere
11. **BUSINESS IMPACT over vuln class** -- severity depends on CONTEXT, not just vuln type
12. **UNDERSTAND THE TARGET DEEPLY** -- before hunting, learn the app like a real user
13. **DON'T OVER-RELY ON AUTOMATION** -- automated scans hit WAFs, trigger rate limits, find the same bugs everyone else finds
14. **HUNT LESS-SATURATED VULN CLASSES** -- XSS/SSRF/XXE have the most competition. Expand into: cache poisoning, Android/mobile vulns, business logic, race conditions, OAuth/OIDC chains, CI/CD pipeline attacks
15. **ONE-HOUR RULE** -- stuck on one target for an hour with no progress? SWITCH CONTEXT
16. **TWO-EYE APPROACH** -- combine systematic testing (checklist) with anomaly detection (watch for unexpected behavior)
17. **T-SHAPED KNOWLEDGE** -- go DEEP in one area and BROAD across everything else

## A->B BUG SIGNAL METHOD (Cluster Hunting)

**When you find bug A, systematically hunt for B and C nearby.** This is one of the most powerful methodologies in bug bounty. Single bugs pay. Chains pay 3-10x more.

### Known A->B->C Chains

| Bug A (Signal) | Hunt for Bug B | Escalate to C |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| IDOR (read) | PUT/DELETE on same endpoint | Full account data manipulation |
| SSRF (any) | Cloud metadata 169.254.169.254 | IAM credential exfil -> RCE |
| XSS (stored) | Check if HttpOnly is set on session cookie | Session hijack -> ATO |
| Open redirect | OAuth redirect_uri accepts your domain | Auth code theft -> ATO |
| S3 bucket listing | Enumerate JS bundles | Grep for OAuth client_secret -> OAuth chain |
| Rate limit bypass | OTP brute force | Account takeover |
| GraphQL introspection | Missing field-level auth | Mass PII exfil |
| Debug endpoint | Leaked environment variables | Cloud credential -> infrastructure access |
| CORS reflects origin | Test with credentials: include | Credentialed data theft |
| Host header injection | Password reset poisoning | ATO via reset link |

### Cluster Hunt Protocol (6 Steps)

```
1. CONFIRM A     Verify bug A is real with an HTTP request
2. MAP SIBLINGS  Find all endpoints in the same controller/module/API group
3. TEST SIBLINGS Apply the same bug pattern to every sibling
4. CHAIN         If sibling has different bug class, try combining A + B
5. QUANTIFY      "Affects N users" / "exposes $X value" / "N records"
6. REPORT        One report per chain (not per bug). Chains pay more.
```

### Real Examples

**Coinbase S3->Bundle->Secret->OAuth chain:**
```
A: S3 bucket publicly listable (Low alone)
B: JS bundles contain OAuth client credentials
C: OAuth flow missing PKCE enforcement
Result: Full auth code interception chain
```

**Vienna Chatbot chain:**
```
A: Debug parameter active in production (Info alone)
B: Chatbot renders HTML in response (dangerouslySetInnerHTML)
C: Stored XSS via bot response visible to other users
Result: P2 finding with real impact
```

# TOP 1% HACKER MINDSET

## How Elite Hackers Think Differently

**Average hunter**: Runs tools, checks checklist, gives up after 30 min.
**Top 1%**: Builds a mental model of the app's internals. Asks "why does this work the way it does?" Not "what does this endpoint do?" but "what business decision led a developer to build it this way, and what shortcut might they have taken?"

## Pre-Hunt Mental Framework

### Step 1: Crown Jewel Thinking
Before touching anything, ask: "If I were the attacker and I could do ONE thing to this app, what causes the most damage?"
- Financial app -> drain funds, transfer to attacker account
- Healthcare -> PII leak, HIPAA violation
- SaaS -> tenant data crossing, admin takeover
- Auth provider -> full SSO chain compromise

### Step 2: Developer Empathy
Think like the developer who built the feature:
- What was the simplest implementation?
- What shortcut would a tired dev take at 2am?
- Where is auth checked -- controller? middleware? DB layer?
- What happens when you call endpoint B without going through endpoint A first?

### Step 3: Trust Boundary Mapping
```
Client -> CDN -> Load Balancer -> App Server -> Database
         ^               ^              ^
    Where does app STOP trusting input?
    Where does it ASSUME input is already validated?
```

### Step 4: Feature Interaction Thinking
- Does this new feature reuse old auth, or does it have its own?
- Does the mobile API share auth logic with the web app?
- Was this feature built by the same team or a third-party?

## The Top 1% Mental Checklist
- [ ] I know the app's core business model
- [ ] I've used the app as a real user for 15+ minutes
- [ ] I know the tech stack (language, framework, auth system, caching)
- [ ] I've read at least 3 disclosed reports for this program
- [ ] I have 2 test accounts ready (attacker + victim)
- [ ] I've defined my primary target: ONE crown jewel I'm hunting for today

## Mindset Rules from Top Hunters

**"Hunt the feature, not the endpoint"** -- Find all endpoints that serve a feature, then test the INTERACTION between them.

**"Authorization inconsistency is your friend"** -- If the app checks auth in 9 places but not the 10th, that's your bug.

**"New == unreviewed"** -- Features launched in the last 30 days have lowest security maturity.

**"Think second-order"** -- Second-order SSRF: URL saved in DB, fetched by cron job. Second-order XSS: stored clean, rendered unsafely in admin panel.

**"Follow the money"** -- Any feature touching payments, billing, credits, refunds is where developers make the most security shortcuts.

**"The API the mobile app uses"** -- Mobile apps often call older/different API versions. Same company, different attack surface, lower maturity.

**"Diffs find bugs"** -- Compare old API docs vs new. Compare mobile API vs web API. Compare what a free user can request vs what a paid user gets in response.

# TOOLS

## Related Skills & Chains

- **`bb-methodology`** — When a hunting session starts and the user is "lost about what to do next." Workflow primitive: this skill is the orchestrator; `bb-methodology` is the 5-phase workflow it routes to. Load `bb-methodology` FIRST, then this skill names the topic-matched hunt-* skills.
- **`hunt-dispatch`** — When PART 0 mode (red team / WAPT) has been confirmed. Workflow primitive: this skill's "what should I do" routing hands off to `hunt-dispatch` for the platform fingerprint + skill-set load.
- **`web2-recon`** + **`offensive-osint`** — When Phase 1 (recon) starts. Workflow primitive: this skill's "Standard Recon Pipeline" section delegates the live execution to `web2-recon` and the operational arsenal (probes / wordlists / regexes) to `offensive-osint`.
- **`triage-validation`** + **`report-writing`** — When a finding completes Phase 4. Workflow primitive: this skill routes to `triage-validation` (7Q gate) → only if all 7 pass, hand off to `report-writing` for the platform-specific body.

## Operator Notes (Claude-BugHunter)

### When to use the orchestrator vs a direct skill

The orchestrator (this skill) is for the "I don't yet know what bug class to hunt for" case. If you've already identified the candidate — "the response reflects my Host header into a JavaScript src URL, that's cache poisoning" — load `hunt-cache-poisoning` directly. The orchestrator's value is the initial routing from a fuzzy intent ("there's a chatbot, what should I test") to a concrete skill set (`hunt-llm-ai` + `hunt-api-misconfig`).

When in doubt: open the orchestrator FIRST on any new target, let it route, then close the orchestrator and work in the loaded skills. Don't keep the orchestrator loaded all session — it occupies context window that could hold actual probe results.

### Common misuse: loading every hunt-* simultaneously

There are 30+ hunt-* skills in this repo. Each carries a non-trivial context footprint. The orchestrator's job is to pick 2-3 by topic match, not to dump the entire library. If the user says "hunt this SaaS app", do NOT load every hunt-* skill — pick `web2-recon` + `hunt-idor` + `hunt-api-misconfig` (the SaaS-typical trio) and stop there. Add more only when the recon output suggests a specific additional class (e.g., GraphQL endpoints found → add `hunt-graphql`).

### Integration with hunt-dispatch

This skill routes by **bug class** (topic match). The `hunt-dispatch` skill added in this repo routes by **engagement mode** (red-team vs WAPT, blackbox vs greybox). They compose:

1. User says "hunt example.com"
2. `bb-methodology` PART 0 confirms mode (e.g., bug-bounty blackbox)
3. `hunt-dispatch` loads the platform-specific attack profile
4. This orchestrator (`bug-bounty`) names the topic-matched hunt-* skills inside the chosen profile

Don't bypass either step. Mode determines what counts as a finding; topic determines what techniques apply.

### Engagement scaffolding

The `/hunt` slash-command and the `hunt <target>` shell helper (see this repo's `cmd/` directory) pre-create the engagement scaffold:

- `targets/<target>/scope.md` — declared scope, pasted from the program page
- `targets/<target>/findings/` — one MD per validated finding
- `targets/<target>/evidence/` — HARs, screenshots, redacted curl transcripts
- `targets/<target>/submissions.txt` — log of submitted-report URLs + states
- `targets/<target>/recon/` — outputs from `subfinder | dnsx | httpx | katana`

Use the scaffold from the start. Half-organized engagements lose findings — a probe result from hour 2 that didn't seem important until hour 14 is unrecoverable if it wasn't logged.

### When the orchestrator gets it wrong

Across 30+ Phase 2 verification tests in this repo, the orchestrator correctly auto-triggered the matching skill in every test — zero misfires. If on a future target the orchestrator misroutes (loads the wrong hunt-* for the topic), the cause is almost always the `description:` frontmatter field on the target skill: a missing keyword that would have matched the user's intent. Fix forward by editing that skill's frontmatter `description:` field to include the missing trigger word. Don't add another layer of dispatch logic; tighten the description.
- **`bb-local-toolkit`** — When you need to know which local clone has the tool for a given task. Workflow primitive: this skill is general bug-bounty guidance; `bb-local-toolkit` answers the specific "where is jhaddix/SecLists installed on this machine?" question.

## References — loaded on demand, not up front

This skill is the router. The detail lives beside it, and the whole point is that you
read one file, not all four. Open with `Read`:

| File | When |
|---|---|
| `references/recon-and-tooling.md` | Phase 1 — mapping the surface, mining source, choosing a tool |
| `references/vuln-playbooks.md` | A class is suspected and you want the quick index before loading its `hunt-*` skill |
| `references/reporting.md` | A finding is confirmed — gates, CVSS, platform templates |
| `references/resources.md` | Platforms, wordlists, payload databases, learning material |

Each per-class playbook is a *summary*. The owning `hunt-*` skill is deeper and is the
one that gets maintained — route to it as soon as the class is confirmed, and close this
skill once routed. Keeping the orchestrator open all session costs context that could
hold actual probe results.
