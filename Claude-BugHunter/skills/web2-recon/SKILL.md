# WEB2 RECON PIPELINE

Full asset discovery from nothing to a prioritized URL list ready for hunting.

---


## The 5-minute rule


> If a target shows nothing interesting after 5 minutes of recon, move on. Don't burn hours on dead surface.

**5-minute kill signals:**
- All subdomains return 403 or static marketing pages
- No API endpoints visible in URLs
- No JavaScript bundles with interesting endpoint paths
- nuclei returns 0 medium/high findings
- No forms, no authentication, no user data

## References — open the step you are on

| File | When |
|---|---|
| `references/pipeline.md` | setup · subdomain enum · live-host probe · fuzzing · tech detection · fallbacks when `dnsx`/`httpx` crash |
| `references/triage-and-scoring.md` | attack-surface triage · target go/no-go scoring · the 30-minute protocol |
| `references/js-and-secrets.md` | JS bundle analysis · secret scanning · GitHub dorking |
| `references/api-spec-discovery.md` | Swagger/OpenAPI/GraphQL spec discovery — the highest-value recon output |
| `references/monitoring.md` | continuous monitoring between hunts |

## Prefer the deterministic path where one exists

Most of this pipeline has a scope-gated, paced, audited implementation already:

```bash
cbh scope <target> --resolve          # mandatory first; UNVERIFIED is not approval
CBH_PROJECT=<engagement> cbh recon <target>
cbh surface <target>
cbh api-manifest swagger.json traffic.har --out recon/<target>/api-manifest.json
cbh workflow  recon/<target>/api-manifest.json --out recon/<target>/workflow.json
cbh vectors seed-from-manifest <host> --manifest … --workflow …
cbh recon-diff <old-manifest> <new-manifest>     # re-recon by delta, not by re-reading
```

Hand-rolled `curl` at a target skips scope, pacing and the audit row, so whatever it finds
cannot back a report. Use `bbcurl` for anything the pipeline does not cover, and check
`bb-local-toolkit` before writing a command around a tool — several named in the references
are not installed on this box.

## Related Skills & Chains

- **`offensive-osint`** — When recon needs concrete probes / wordlists / regexes beyond the basic pipeline. Workflow primitive: this skill produces the URL set; `offensive-osint` provides the secret regexes, GraphQL/Swagger paths, and identity-fabric probes you apply to that URL set.
- **`osint-methodology`** — When you need a severity rubric for what you discovered. Workflow primitive: after recon outputs `subdomains.txt` / `live-hosts.txt` / `urls.txt`, score each asset against `osint-methodology`'s findings rubric to decide what gets a finding versus what stays in the asset graph.
- **`hunt-subdomain`** — When recon surfaces stale CNAMEs / dangling DNS. Workflow primitive: any subdomain in `subdomains.txt` whose CNAME points to S3 / GitHub Pages / Heroku / Shopify / Azure should auto-route to `hunt-subdomain` for takeover validation.
- **`security-arsenal`** — When the URL set is classified by `gf` and ready for active testing. Workflow primitive: `gf xss/ssrf/sqli/idor` output names become payload-class queries against `security-arsenal`'s payload library.
- **`bb-methodology`** — When recon completes and Phase 1 transitions to Phase 2 (Mapping). Workflow primitive: hand the live host + URL set back to `bb-methodology` Phase 2 for endpoint mapping and Phase 3 vulnerability discovery routing.

### Cross-TLD pivot discipline

Phase 2C's HackerOne VDP recon walked from `hackerone.com` (24 subdomains) into a sister TLD `hacker.one` (12 more subdomains found in JS bundle references). Operators who only enumerate `*.target.com` miss attack surface that the target legitimately operates on a different domain.

Always grep JS bundles for plausible sibling TLDs:

```bash
# pull all JS, grep for sibling-TLD candidates
for url in $(cat live-hosts.txt); do
  curl -s "$url" | grep -oE 'src="[^"]+\.js"' | sed 's/src="//;s/"//'
done | sort -u > js-urls.txt

# then on each JS file
for j in $(cat js-urls.txt); do
  curl -s "$j" | grep -oE '[a-z0-9.-]+\.(io|app|one|dev|test|cloud|ai|co)' | sort -u
done | sort -u > sibling-tld-candidates.txt
```

Common sibling-TLD patterns: `target.com → target.io / target.app / target.one / target.dev / target.test / target-corp.com / target-cdn.net`. Always validate via WHOIS or by checking if the cert chain trusts the same internal CA before treating the sister TLD as in-scope.

### Subdomain wordlist priorities by 2026

Top discovery prefixes by hit rate against enterprise VDPs in our 2024-2026 corpus:

```
mta-sts.*          api.*              docs.*
dev-*              staging-*          *-qa
*-stage            *-uat              events.*
portal.*           customer.*         partner.*
vendor.*           internal-*         admin-*
employee-*         hr.*               jobs.*
sso.*              auth.*             id.*
```

Internal-looking subdomains often expose more surface than the marketing site — `partner.target.com` and `vendor-portal.target.com` frequently have weaker auth than the main app because they're scoped for "trusted" external users. Always send a probe to the long-tail wordlist after the standard subfinder run completes.

### Live-host probe: how to fingerprint stack quickly

`curl -sI <host>` headers are 80% of the fingerprint:

- `Server:` — apache / nginx / cloudflare / kestrel (= .NET Core) / openresty / envoy
- `X-Powered-By:` — PHP version, ASP.NET version, Express.js
- `X-Drupal-Cache`, `X-Generator: Drupal 9` — Drupal
- `X-Generator: WordPress` — WordPress
- `Via:` — CDN chain (1.1 varnish, 1.1 cloudfront)
- `Set-Cookie:` names — `JSESSIONID` (Java), `PHPSESSID` (PHP), `ASP.NET_SessionId` (.NET), `connect.sid` (Express), `laravel_session` (Laravel)

JS bundle filename patterns:

- `/_next/static/` = Next.js
- `/_nuxt/` = Nuxt
- `/assets/static/` with hash filenames = Vite
- `/static/js/main.*.chunk.js` = Create React App
- `runtime.*.js + polyfills.*.js + main.*.js` = Angular CLI

The first 10s of recon should yield a stack guess; the rest is targeting. If your fingerprint contradicts itself (Server says nginx, Set-Cookie says ASP.NET) you've found a reverse proxy front-end — note the origin app for later smuggling/cache attacks.

### GitHub Pages 404 vs takeover signal

Critical distinction operators get wrong:

- **"Page not found · GitHub Pages"** with HTTP 404 means the repo EXISTS — NOT a takeover.
- **"There isn't a GitHub Pages site here"** means the repo was deleted — TAKEOVER candidate.

Same distinction for CloudFront:

- **"Error - 404"** with `Server: CloudFront` = distribution exists, origin returned 404 — NOT a takeover.
- **"The request could not be satisfied"** with `X-Cache: Error from cloudfront` = origin missing entirely — potential takeover.

Phase 2C verified both patterns live. Always check the EXACT response body string before filing a takeover finding — the takeover-scanner tools (subzy, subjack) match on multiple fingerprints and frequently false-positive on the "still owned, just empty" case.

### Toolchain fallback

Already covered in this file's Phase 2C addition. Quick reminder: dnsx/httpx may segfault on macOS arm64; the dig+curl fallback works for < 100-host runs in ~14 seconds. Don't burn an hour debugging Go binary panics when the fallback gets you to the same URL set.
