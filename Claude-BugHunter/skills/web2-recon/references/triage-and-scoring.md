# Turning recon output into a go/no-go

## ATTACK SURFACE TRIAGE

### Find Interesting Targets in URL List

```bash
# Parameters worth testing
cat /tmp/urls.txt | grep -E "[?&](id|user|file|path|url|redirect|next|src|token|key|api_key)=" | tee /tmp/interesting-params.txt

# API endpoints
cat /tmp/urls.txt | grep -E "/api/|/v1/|/v2/|/v3/|/graphql|/rest/|/gql" | tee /tmp/api-endpoints.txt

# File upload endpoints
cat /tmp/urls.txt | grep -E "upload|file|attachment|document|image|avatar|photo|media" | tee /tmp/uploads.txt

# Admin/internal paths
cat /tmp/urls.txt | grep -E "/admin|/internal|/debug|/test|/staging|/dev|/management|/console" | tee /tmp/admin-paths.txt

# Authentication endpoints
cat /tmp/urls.txt | grep -E "/oauth|/login|/auth|/sso|/saml|/oidc|/callback|/token" | tee /tmp/auth-paths.txt
```

### gf Patterns (Quick Classification)

```bash
# Install gf patterns: https://github.com/tomnomnom/gf
cat /tmp/urls.txt | gf xss | tee /tmp/xss-candidates.txt
cat /tmp/urls.txt | gf ssrf | tee /tmp/ssrf-candidates.txt
cat /tmp/urls.txt | gf idor | tee /tmp/idor-candidates.txt
cat /tmp/urls.txt | gf sqli | tee /tmp/sqli-candidates.txt
cat /tmp/urls.txt | gf redirect | tee /tmp/redirect-candidates.txt
cat /tmp/urls.txt | gf lfi | tee /tmp/lfi-candidates.txt
cat /tmp/urls.txt | gf rce | tee /tmp/rce-candidates.txt
```

## TARGET SCORING — GO / NO-GO

Score before spending time. Skip if score < 4.

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---|
| Max bounty >= $5K | +2 |
| Large user base (>100K) or handles money | +2 |
| Program launched < 60 days ago | +2 |
| Complex features: API, OAuth, file upload, GraphQL | +1 |
| Recent code/feature changes (GitHub, changelog) | +1 |
| Private program (less competition) | +1 |
| Tech stack you know | +1 |
| Source code available | +1 |
| Prior disclosed reports to study | +1 |

**< 4:** Skip
**4-5:** Only if nothing better available
**6-8:** Good — spend 1-3 days
**>= 9:** Excellent — spend up to 1 week

### Pre-Dive Hard Kill Signals

1. Max bounty < $500 → not worth your time
2. All recent reports are N/A or duplicate → hunters saturated it
3. Scope is only a static marketing page → no attack surface
4. Company < 5 employees with no revenue → won't pay
5. Explicitly excludes your planned bug class in rules

## 30-MINUTE RECON PROTOCOL

### Minutes 0-5: Read Program Page

```
Note:
- ALL in-scope assets (every domain listed)
- Out-of-scope list (read carefully — common trap)
- Safe harbor statement
- Impact types accepted (some exclude "low")
- Average bounty amount (signals program generosity)
```

### Minutes 5-15: Asset Discovery

Run the standard pipeline above. Focus on live.txt output.

### Minutes 15-25: Surface Map

Run gf patterns and the interesting-params grep above.

### Minutes 25-30: Manual Exploration

Open Burp Suite. Browse the app with proxy on:
1. Register an account
2. Perform main user actions (create/read/update/delete resources)
3. Note all API calls in Burp history
4. Look for endpoints not in your URL list

### After 30 min: Prioritize

```
Priority 1: API endpoints with ID parameters → IDOR candidates
Priority 2: File upload features → XSS/RCE candidates
Priority 3: OAuth/SSO flows → auth bypass candidates
Priority 4: Search/filter with user input → SQLi/SSRF/SSTI candidates
Priority 5: Admin/debug endpoints → auth bypass candidates
```
